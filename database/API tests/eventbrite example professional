It is an excellent opportunity to learn about the challenges and opportunities on the continent. Come listen to distinguished speakers who are helping to shape the future and trajectory of the abundant continent called AFRICA\nNew York 2018 Theme: Sustaining a Peaceful and Prosperous Africa\nDate: 28th and 29th September 2018\nVenue: One United Nations Plaza, New York, NY 10017, USA \nCommonwealth Africa Initiative in association with GLEEHD Foundation and Youth for Transparency International, an organisation in Consultative Status with United Nations. \n\nThe Africa Forum New York 2018: Sustaining a Peaceful and Prosperous Africa\nYear 2018 has been designated by the United Nations as the Year of Sustaining Peace, and in recognition of the fundamental interlinkages between the 2030 Agenda and AU Agenda 2063, The Africa Forum New York is conceived as a high level thematic SDG-related event during the 2018 UNGA that will explore the global implications and meanings of such a designation for Africa, as well as showcase critical and emerging voices in the African peace and economic prosperity arena. \nThe New York Forum will consider the complex relationship between growth, prosperity and sustainability. The event is expected to challenge leaders to commit more to improving lives, fighting inequality, and promoting environmental sustainability on the continent. The Forum will draw up policy recommendations on the structural reforms needed to enable Africa’s economies to create continued wealth and prosperity and to maintain a high level of citizens’ well-being in the medium to long-term.\nConvening over 100 delegates and a number of high profile speakers, the New York Forum will explore conversations on how to ensure peace and prosperity enjoyed, in Africa after many years of militarisation and dictatorship. \n \nWhy is this important! \nThe overarching objective of the event is to discuss the mutually reinforcing linkages between Sustaining Peace and Prosperity in Africa and the 2030 Agenda/AU Agenda 2063, including at country level and ways in which to leverage them optimally in an integrated framework that can assist AU Member States, civil society and other stakeholders to coordinate and enhance their efforts in implementing the SDGs/Agenda 2063 and achieving sustainable peace on the continent. Economic growth in Africa has been inadequate to eradicate poverty. In addition, the growth generated has largely been unequal. Seven out of the ten most unequal countries in the world are in Africa. Eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in Africa therefore hinges on fostering inclusive and sustainable growth and the attainment of gender quality and women’s empowerment is a critical dimension of inclusion in the region.\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent a universal call to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all. They form part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development adopted by 191 member states of the United Nations in September 2015. The SDGs set 169 targets for global achievement by 2030, in areas such as the protection of natural resources, climate change, disaster resilience, peace and security, equality, economic growth and decent jobs. These are all vital issues for Africa and mirrored in the Africa’s Agenda 2063. CAFI supports the enhanced ambitions the SDGs and Agenda 2063 embody, and is fully committed to helping Commonwealth Africa nations to meet them. Building better, more sustainable infrastructure, Peace and Prosperity will provide the basis for achieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063.\nAchieving the SDGs and Agenda 2063 will require massive new international, domestic, public, and private financial support. \n \nTAF New York will also be an opportunity to:\nFurther discuss how to finance the actualisation of Agenda 2063 in Africa. \nShowcase that Sustainable peace in Africa cannot be achieved without the engagement of civil society in generating solutions for the problems that have threatened the continent. .\nPromote how to enhance the leadership of women in the transformation of Africa with a focus on governance, peace and stability. Evidence shows that women play an important role as drivers of change in achieving sustainable peace and development.\nConsider the role that women and youth in particular can play in the effort to implement the 2030 Agenda and to sustain peace;\nThe radical heart of the Sustainable Development Goals is their promise to leave no one behind and to reach the furthest behind first. This is a game-changing commitment to the poorest, most vulnerable people around the world who face violent conflict, disease, natural disaster, and unstable government.\nThis meeting will consist of an opening segment, a segment with contributions from high-level speakers, an interactive discussion with experts in this area; afternoon workshops and a closing segment.",
