            <p>Have you ever been an in depth conference, seminar, or event that had more information than you were able to handle?</p>
            <p>Whether it be for self development, professional networking, or continuing education, Next Step Events helps you build upon those experiences and connect with other event goers to expand the conversation.</p>
            
            <p>It's easy to begin a discussion, share ideas, and learn more about the events in a way you were never able to before!</p>
            
            <p>Each event has rooms where groups can gather or overarching topics can be built upon. From "General" to the nitty gritty of "What you learned" is available.</p>
            
            <p>Next Step Events connects with Eventbrite and their library of thousands of events or you can create your own!</p>
            
            <p>Create Discussion Threads and add messages to further your learning or even learn about new things other members bring up.</p>
