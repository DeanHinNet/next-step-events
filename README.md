# Next Step Events

### Connect and continue the discussion, growth, and activities after your events, seminars, and conferences.

Users will be able to share what they've learn, insights, and just overall experiences when it comes to events where you grow, learn, collaborate, network, and more. These are often deep and dense experiences that aren't just for enjoyment but meaningful change and growth. 

Whether they're self-development seminars (Tony Robbins), hackathons, or million dollar seminars, there's often more information than can truly be absorbed in such a short period of time. Next Step Events allows users to reinforce, re-live, and ultimately cultivate what they've learned with others who attended the event!
